## Description
This digital map displays the locations of public, non-military airports within Washington state. The map provides a number of basemaps in the top right corner to provide different contexts based on the user's needs. The map loads in on the airports dataset automatically, and it displays all the airport markers in the dataset. Clicking on any of these markers will reveal the name of the airport in a popup window. The main function of this map resides in the distance calculator, which can be switched on in the top right legend of the map. After turning it on, clicking on any two airport markers will calculate the distance between the two airports and displays in the answer box in the bottom. It will also draw a polyline between the two markers and zoom into it.

## Purpose
The purpose of this digital map is to provide users with the ability to quickly and easily determine the distance between two locations of different airports within the state. While the utility of this tool is niche, it can provide a lot of help to people who fly recreationally and often travel between different airports while renting out airplanes. Knowing how far different airports can be and which locations are available options to pilots can help them make better decisions about the places they can travel to.

## Data Sources
The only data source needed to make this project was a dataset on Washington airports by the Washington State Department of Transportation, which can be found [here](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/ddb7c46710a44a5884a3f95dc8672fef_0?geometry=-127.648%2C45.998%2C-113.772%2C48.605).
